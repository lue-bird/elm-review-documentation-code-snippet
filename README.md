# elm-review-documentation-code-snippet

[ðŸ”§ `Review.Documentation.CodeSnippet.check`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/lue-bird/elm-review-documentation-example/1.0.0/Review-Documentation-CodeSnippet#check "provides fixes")
automatically generates tests for examples in your readme and module documentation.
If you know [`elm-verify-examples`](https://github.com/stoeffel/elm-verify-examples), you also know how this works.
There are only a few extras like checking for types you'll get only by using this rule instead.

```elm
import Review.Rule
import Review.Documentation.Example

config : List Review.Rule.Rule
config =
    [ Review.Documentation.CodeSnippet.check
    ]
```

## why?

  - finding broken examples is confusing and will frustrate users

  - finding examples that show incorrect results is even worse
    
  - examples in the documentation quickly get out of sync with your API.
    Now, how do you find all the places where things changed for your examples?
    The compiler certainly doesn't check them which makes it easy to miss some

## possible ideas for the future

  - Make up fuzzy check syntax. Something like
    ```elm
    --* xs is list unit
    List.take 3 xs |> List.length
    --> Basics.maximum 3 (xs |> List.length)

    --* xs, ys is list unit
    List.map2 Tuple.pair xs ys |> List.length
    --> Basics.minimum (xs |> List.length) (ys |> List.length)
    ```
    where `list unit` is interpreted as `Fuzz.list (Fuzz.constant ())`

    which established the core ideas and syntax in a nice command line tool

  - Rupert Smith for [elm-syntax-dsl](https://dark.elm.dmy.fr/packages/the-sett/elm-syntax-dsl/latest) which can pretty print a whole elm file and is compatible with `elm-syntax`
